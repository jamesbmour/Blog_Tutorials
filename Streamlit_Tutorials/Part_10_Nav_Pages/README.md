I want Descript to create an artificial version of my voice that I can use to create speech that sounds like me.

I am training my voice by reading the following statement: Imagine a big blue ball spinning in space. That's our Earth.

On it, there are tall mountains, deep oceans, and huge forests with animals.

In cities, people talk, play, and work. We all have different voices: some people speak softly while others are loud.

Every day, we tell stories, ask questions, and share jokes.
