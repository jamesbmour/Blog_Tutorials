The `secrets.toml` file is where you store your secrets locally. It should be placed in the `.streamlit` folder

st.markdown(
    """
That's it for our tutorial on Streamlit Connections and Secrets! Here's a quick recap:

1. Use `st.connection` to create database connections.
2. `SnowflakeConnection` replaces the deprecated `SnowparkConnection`.
3. `SQLConnection` provides a flexible way to work with SQL databases.
4. Use `st.secrets` to securely access sensitive information in your app.
5. Store your secrets in the `secrets.toml` file in the `.streamlit` folder.

Remember to always keep your secrets secure and never expose them in your code or version control.
Happy Streamlit coding!
